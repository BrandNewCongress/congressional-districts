# Congressional District Map

A map of congressional districts and information about them.

## How to run locally

You will first need to have the AIRTABLE_API_KEY set in your environment.
Then you can simple run

```
$ node index.js
```

The service will be running [locally](http://localhost:5000).

## Future Improvements

* More information displayed inline
* Link out to congressional district wiki
* Link out to congressional candidate wiki
* More knobs and dials to explore the data with
* A way to refresh the data without a server restart
